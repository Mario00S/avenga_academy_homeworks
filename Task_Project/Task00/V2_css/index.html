    <h1 id="top-nav">My Favourite Hobby</h1>
    <p>
      Hi I am <a href="about.html">Mario</a> and my favourite hobby is
      <em>ski touring.</em> <br />I have started the journey in ski touring 3
      years ago, and never looked back. <br />Ski touring is also known as ski
      mountaineering, which is a great oportunity for someone to be active and
      experience the joy of skiing, or hiking and then ski down the slopes.
    </p>
    <!-- more information about the hobby - main section first -->
    <h2 id="main-first">How have I discovered this sport?</h2>
    <p>
      I was lucky enough that my dad was experimenting with this, couple of
      years before getting a second pair of skis, so that's why I got the
      oportunity to try out for myself. Before I started <em>ski touring,</em> I
      had not skied for about 15 years, so that was an issue to some extent.
      Learning first to ski is the main prerequisite. Additionally good
      mountaineering skills are very important.

    <!-- main section second -->
    <h2 id="main-second">Why it's so interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      When going on a tour especially on a sunny day, you get yourself into the
      lonely mountains accompanied by a small group of people that like to spend
      the day in the nature as well.

        >As Macedonia is not a good ski destination, ski touring is a great way
        to skip to long ques while waiting for the ski lifts and get away from
        the crowd.</em
      >
      The other thing is that during the winter the mountains are not visited by
      a lots of people and especially if you go on parts of the country that do
      not have a ski centers you are in for a treat.

    <h2 id="main-tird">How to get started?</h2>
    <p>
      Coming from my personal experience, the best thing to get into ski touring
      is to start mountaineering, you need to be prepared to do tours that
      typically cover 1000 meters of elevation, and about 5-10 km in one way.
      Hiking during the winter is another discipline as you need to prepare
      yourself with a lot of equipement, not just buying the equpement but
      learning how to use it. At first more advisable thing would be to do tours
      on-piste with more experienced ski touring mentors.
